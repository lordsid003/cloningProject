# Genus: A Cloning Project
A hypothetical website named "Genus" which uses Tensforflow.js (Machine learning library maintained by Google) for object detection of some pre-trained objects.
* Sci-fi web design built from scratch
* Tensorflow.js for detecting objects using Webcam with certain confidence threshold
* Scanning layout to mimic the feel of cloning the detected objects
